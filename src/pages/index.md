        The start of any SEO project begins with the audit and the firestarter of any good audit will be the crawl analysis. Tools like Screaming Frog and Sitebulb makes SEOs lives easier by crawling through a website, identifying 'spider traps', technical problems and issues on scale. From there, you can make a plan to perform fixes on a one-to-one basis and on scale to improve indexability, crawlability and SERP performance.

        Shopify has exploded in popularity in the past four years as a user friendly, frictionless ecommerce experience.
        As a hosted platform, it comes with strict limitations that provide a challenge in implementing complex Information Architecture and best practice SEO. Working within these constraints and pushing the liquid templating language to its limits can make the most out of a Shopify store to sell online.

        You can only control what you measure. Google Analytics is an enterprise level analytics tool available for everyone and is critical for understanding how your web application performs. Creating filtered views, segments, reports, integrating with Google Ads and Search Console data to gain insights on your paid amplication and organic campaigns. Others tools like Yandex.Metrica and VWO complete the toolset, gaining heat map and session recording insights.

        Melbourne has a thriving and inclusive technology community and it is on full display with many of the local Meetups. I have attended Meetups regularly for the last five years, with the Melbourne SEO Meetup being my monthly ritual to catch up with friends within the SEO space. Other Meetups I try to attend every once in a while are the Melbourne Shopify Meetup, Drupal Meetup and eCommerce Meetup. Come by some time and say hi =)

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
