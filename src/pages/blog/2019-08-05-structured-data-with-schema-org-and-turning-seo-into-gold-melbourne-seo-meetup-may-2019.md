##Turning SEO into Gold by Iain Calvert

![Iain Calvert presenting at the SEO Melbourne Meetup](img/blog/iain-calvert-presenting-seo-meetup-melbourne-may-2019.png)
[Iain's Slides on 'How to turn SEO into Gold' are available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MmJFBiU8CHkaEMp8A8thJNqG4AZrigQv7xs39EyD7UU/edit?usp=sharing)

[Iain Calvert](https://hellocalvert.co/) did a great presentation and provided real insights on the practical ways to scale an SEO operation and get value. Useful, useful stuff, especially for the Agency-side people in the audience.

He began his presentation with a little humour, poking fun at the unreasonable demands of some clients and bosses on how they handle SEO.

Iain provided 5 tips on his presentation on how to get value from SEO.

### Tip #1 - NEVER assume your client or boss knows what you think is obvious

Iain mentioned the dangers of having specialised knowledge and making presumptions on what is considered 'obvious'. He also mentioned how to share what is seemingly obvious pieces of information that may be truly valuable to the person you are with - whether they be boss or client.

### Tip #2 - Make it simple with analogies

He emphasised the importance of using analogies in communicating SEO information to people in an easy to digest manner.

Iain provided three examples:
 -  **SEO Is Like Drilling Holes In A Dam:** Here, SEO is provided as an example of a lot of work to get tiny results - but can become overwhelming when the dam's infrastructure breaks. Every little bit of work counts and produces results long term in an overwhelming rush of water.
 - **Links Are Like Recommendations Not Votes:** Here, Iain used the example of taking financial advice from a crazy guy on the street. How likely are you to follow their advice? The same can be true from links - 100 crazy people telling you to do one thing vs the leading expert in the field telling you otherwise, who would you go with?
 - **Putting The Right Car In The Google Race:** This example showcased two cars - one beat-up bomb that has been modified and a fancy racecar. The analogy here is regarding platforms, and how having the right platform will allow you to compete in the SERPs rather than over-working a website that isn't capable of competing in the first place.

 I thought the analogies work well, though as an SEO person I do tire of the car analogy. My favourite analogy that I use is regarding how the SERPs work like a local business.

 Ranking #1 in Google on a good query is like having prominent real estate on a busy street full of potential customers. Ranking high for the wrong keyword would be having an unrelated business like a comedy club on the way to a busy stadium. Ranking high for a low volume keyword would be like having prominent real estate on a deserted street.

 Concepts like this 'connect' with the minds of businesspeople when they are explained in these terms. It makes it based in reality and the ideas stick.

 ### Tip #3 - Know Your Numbers

 This was not a discussion on metrics or KPIs, but rather specifically the numbers in running an agency. Iain mainly spoke about the revenue too salary ratio, and where the ideal value is. Too little revenue means too little work whilst too much vs salary means you don't have enough people.

 ### Tip #4 - Offshore Properly

 This was an interesting an unexpected turn in the presentation as Iain went in-depth on the offshoring process too take care of menial tasks and maximise the value you are providing to clients.

 Iain spoke highly of [Filta](https://filtaglobal.com/offshoring/), an offshoring agency with an **outstanding** looking office in Manila, Philippines. 

 From what I understood, they provide a service to help build your high-performance offshore team. Whilst not directly relevant, this was certainly interesting to the audience and became a major part of the presentation.

 <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-I36ss_QrY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

 Iain's final list of advice on offshoring was these key points:

 - **Dedicated team:**  Have a team, not freelancers who can work together with team and each other.
 - **Don’t do content:** Even though the Philippines have a high level of English proficiency, quality matters and there is so much within the context of Australia that makes having local writers important. Even offshoring to primary English speaking nations such as USA or America do not compare to Australia writers.
 - **Process work:** Assign the offshore team with process work to make _your_ job more easier and more scalable.
- **Brains here braun there:** Rely on strategic think with your in-house team whilst simple, time-consuming tasks can be offshore. This provides the best value to yourself and clients.
- **Save 63%:** Offshoring can make significant savings for the team and allows you to work on the balance of revenue vs salary as you scale your agency.

### Tip #5 - How To Get More Time To Implement

Iain begun this part of the presentation with a little bit of humour:

- Don’t be a well known 3 letter Melbourne based SEO Company
- Get shit done

Certain 3 letter Melbourne based SEO companies have... let's say, a questionable reputation amongst search professionals.

The second point was the meat of this section, which was to be productive.

[Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) for dashboarding will save a lot of time in doing analysis and providing reports to clients. Having various data sources such as Google Analytics and Google Sheets can present rich data visualisations that provide value to clients.

[Answer the Public](https://answerthepublic.com/) is a service that shows questions related to keywords. Using this tool, you can use this to form some topic-based keywords to produce content alongside your client. I personally prefer [Scrapebox](http://www.scrapebox.com/) for this type of research, but I am old school.

### Tip #6 - Don’t Charge By The Hour

There is no gold in SEO by charging by the hour, according to Iain. He showcased a graph showcasing that the more hours and more people are involved in a project, the more complex it becomes. It is not economically feasible to charge by hour when tackling difficult projects that require lots of people with different specialties.

Instead, Iain insists that you charge by _value_. 

- Work out what they value (not what you value)
- Understand your “cost price” hours + tools
- Understand your “cost price” hours + tools

Iain recommends reading **[Priceless: The Hidden Psychology of Value](https://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Hidden-Psychology-William-Poundstone/dp/B00CB5WEJ2)** to get an understanding of creating value to a client so that you can bill appropriately.

### Turning SEO into Gold Summary

I found Iain's presentation insightful, even as an in-house marketer who isn't in the target audience. his talk can be summarised with these 6 points:

- NEVER assume your client/boss knows what you take for granted
- Use analogies to make boss/client understand
- Know YOUR numbers that matter
- Offshore properly
- Set yourself up to implement more
- Charge by value not hours

He was a welcome addition to the Melbourne SEO Meetup speaker list and I am sure we will welcome him today.

##Structured Data Explained: Everything you wish you knew about schema.org by Peter Macinkovic
![Peter Macinkovic presenting about Schema at the SEO Melbourne Meetup](img/blog/peter-macinkovic-presenting-structured-data-and-schema-seo-alt-angle.png)

Following Iain, it was my time to shine as I talked all things [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) to the Melbourne SEO community. I was slotted 45 minutes, but I ended up talking for 90 minutes due to everyone's insightful questions! Full slides are below:

<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/967yKV4884Pwqb" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/PeterMacinkovic/structured-data-explained-everything-you-wish-you-knew-about-schemaorg" title="Structured Data Explained - Everything you wish you knew about schema.org" target="_blank">Structured Data Explained - Everything you wish you knew about schema.org</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/PeterMacinkovic" target="_blank">Peter Macinkovic</a></strong> </div>

The talk covered 5 core areas around Structured Data and Schema.org:

- What is Structured Data
- Standardised Formats
- Schema.org
- Google SERP Enhancements
- Schema.org debugging and gotchas

### What is Structured Data

Structured Data provides context and semantic meaning to HTML Content. It helps makes human readable content structured so it is machine readable.

Machines aren't very good at understanding semantic meaning in human readable content and with Structured Data we can help close this gap.

> When information is highly structured and predictable, search engines can more easily organize and display it in creative ways.

To demonstrate, I showcased a Google result for NFL Quarterback Tom Brady in the Search Results and annotated elements of the page that could be structured in a semantic way.

### Standardised Formats of Structured Data for the Web

Structuring Data for semantic meaning has a long rich history, going all the way back to now outdated formats used to categorise data for the purposes of education.

Structured Data for the Web began to formalise in 2004 with RDFa, and other the years format improved, got standardised and now enjoy usage - in particular for SEO. Here is a brief timeline:

- **[RDFa](http://rdfa.info/):** Developed in 2004, standardised in 2007.
- **[Microformats](http://microformats.org/):** Developed in 2005. A more design focused standard for humans, not robots.
- **[Microdata](https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/):** Developed in 2009 by [Ian Hickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hickson) - the Father of [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5).
- **[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/):** Developed in 2010. A serialised form of [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) Format.

#### RDFa 

RDFa is a legacy of [XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/) and was the first form of Structured Data for the Web. Since 2009, [RDFa Lite](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/) had become the standard for RDFa structured data.

RDFa uses HTML Attributes to structure markup rendered on a web page. It has the following syntax:

- **vocab:** sets the _Item Scope_.
- **typeof:** sets _Item Type_.
- **property:** sets the _property_ of an item.

RDFa is still used today, but it is the least used of the three major formats.

    </ul>
</details>
<br/>

#### Microdata

Microdata is the brainchild of Ian Hickson, who designed HTML5. 2009 was a big year for the semantic web, with HTML5 and Microdata leading the way in creating a cleaner, more structured web.

Microdata was designed to be a simpler syntax when directly compared to RDFa and fitted well with the new semantic elements we had received in HTML5.

Between 2013-2018, [development was terminated](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2013Oct/0018.html), and was [renewed in 2018](https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/) under the guidance of [Chaals McCathie Nevile](https://www.w3.org/People/Charles/) from [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) and [Dan Brickley](https://www.w3.org/People/DanBri/) from [Google](https://www.google.com/).

Much like RDFa, Microformats use attributes to structure data as key-value pairs. it has the following syntax:

- **itemscope:** sets _Item Scope_.
- **itemtype:** sets _Item Type_.
- **itemprop:** sets _property_ of an Item.

Microdata is the most used of the Sematic Markup forms of structured data due to its simpler syntax and how it was designed to be used with HTML5 in tandem. The lack of development is a major issue in adopting it as well as issues with scope with nested properties in messy markup.

    </ul>

#### JSON-LD

[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) was developed in 2010 as a serialised form of Linked Data in JSON syntax and has quickly risen to be the format of choice in implementing Structured Data on the web - particularly with Schema.org and the [Google Knowledge Graph](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/). 

Simple to implement with `<script>` tags, JSON-LD became widespread due its robust implementation and reduction in scope conflict. An [official endorsement by Google](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-structured-data-preference/297479/) also made it the format of choice by SEOs and software vendors alike.

JSON-LD uses the JSON syntax to implement structured data that can be read in an RDF standard. An object in JSON-LD can be used to set _Context_, _Types_ and _Properties_.

The only downside with JSON-LD is that you use the sematic structuring of Markup in the DOM, however with new features such as [cssSelector](https://schema.org/cssSelector) and [xpath](https://schema.org/xpath) within the Items such as [WebPageElement](https://schema.org/WebPageElement), the Semantic Gap is closing. JSON-lD has been constantly worked on since its inception and the current draft is by [Gregg Kellogg](https://greggkellogg.net/).

### What is Schema.org

[Schema.org](https://schema.org) is a collaboratively maintained community to create, maintain and promote schemas for structured data.

It was [founded in 2011](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html) by the big four search engines at the time - [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Yahoo!](https://yahoo.com) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/).

#### Itemscope, Context Itemtype & Properties

- **Itemscope** specifies the block of HTML code is an itemtype for RDFa & Microdata
- **Context** in JSON-LD sets the schema the object belongs to. This is typically set to https://schema.org
- **Itemtype** is the schema object, which can either be a Thing or DataType
- **Properties** are the attributes of an Itemtype

#### Itemtypes

![Itemtype properties and how they work](/img/blog/how-schema-org-item-types-work.png)

**Itemtypes** are _Scehma Objects_. All Item Types are derived of _[Thing](https://schema.org/Thing)_ except [Data Types](https://schema.org/DataType).

The syntax of Item Types is in [Pascal Case](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase), also know as _Upper Camel Case_.

There are 9 sub-types of **Thing** which embody all Item Types with the exception of Data Types.

**Data Types** are objects liek [Text](https://schema.org/Text), [Boolean](https://schema.org/Boolean), [URL](https://schema.org/URL) etc. which are more for strictly typed data.

[A full list of types is available on Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html)

Below is a visual Representation of the Itemtypes of schema.org v2.2 (circa 2015)
This Interactive Diagram is courtesy of Fabio Valsecchi, Gregg Kellogg and Sandro Hawke

![Visual Representation of Item Types on Schema.org](/img/blog/representative-list-of-item-types-on-schema-org.png)

#### Properties

**Properties** are part of Item Types. They help classify _properties_ of an _ItemType_ in a structured nature.

Properties have **Expected Types** that they may passthrough. Typically this will be either a subtype of **Thing** or a **Data Type**

Properties are in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), specifically lower camel case.

Properties can accept an Item Type that is a sub type of Thing. The Expected Type of an object can also be a **Super Type** or **Sub Type** of the Expected Type, as long as that property exists for the **Super Type** or **Sub Type**.

**Sub Types** may gain specific properties for it and its children that differ from the **Super Type**.

### Schema.org by Example

#### Expected Types

<div class="grid-4x8">
    <div>
    <img 
    src="/img/blog/expected-types-in-action.png"
    alt="Property and Expected Type in a Table on Schema.org"
    />
    </div>
    <div>        
        <p>Expected Types are Item Types that the Schema.org definition expect for a particular property.</p>
        <p>Typically this will be either a subtype of <a href="https://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a> or a <a href="https://schema.org/DataType">Data Type</a></p>
        <p>Expected Types may still validate with a Sub Type of Super Type</p>
        <p>e.g. Expected Type of <a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a> can be a <a href="https://schema.org/Pharmacy">Pharmacy</a></p>
        <p>e.g. Expected type of <a href="https://schema.org/ListItem">ListItem</a> can be a <a href="https://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a> </p>
        <p>Expected Types may have some mandatory fields beyond name or id when validating for <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">Google Search Enhancements</a></p>
    </div>
</div>

#### Sub Types

<div class="grid-4x8">
    <div>
    <img 
    src="/img/blog/sub-types-in-action-on-schema.org.png"
    alt="Type Hierarchy in a Table on Schema.org for Pharmacy"
    />
    </div>
    <div>        
        <p>Subtypes inherit properties from their parent Item Type.</p>
<p>Subtypes may have multiple Super Types that it can inherit properties from.</p>
<p>e.g. a <a href="https://schema.org/Pharmacy">Pharmacy</a> can inherit properties from <a href="https://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/Organization">Organization</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/Place">Place</a>, <a href="https://schema.org/MedicalOrganization">MedicalOrganization</a>, and <a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a></p>
<p>e.g. a <a href="https://schema.org/Pharmacy">Pharmacy</a> can be a SubType of either a <a href="https://schema.org/MedicalBusiness">MedicalBusiness</a> or <a href="https://schema.org/MedicalOrganization">MedicalOrganization</a> </p>
    </div>
</div>
